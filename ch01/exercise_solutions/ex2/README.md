# Exercise 2

## Question

Add a target to the Makefile called `clean` that removes the `hello_world` binary and any other temporary files created by `go build`. Take a look at the [Go command documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go) to find a `go` command to help implement this.

## Solution

See `Makefile` in this directory.
